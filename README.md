## **Introduction**
The **Asteroid Visualization Tool** aims to educate users about the risks and characteristics of near-Earth objects (NEOs). By leveraging NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API, this project provides real-time data and interactive 3D visualization to help users explore and understand asteroids in a more engaging way.

---

## **Features**
- **Fetch Real-Time Asteroid Data**: Retrieves NEO data from NASA’s NEO API based on user-defined date ranges.
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Visualize asteroid orbits in a 3D space using VPython.
- **Filter Asteroids**: Filter asteroids by size, close approach date, or minimum distance from Earth.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive interface built with Tkinter for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Educational Content**: Inform users about the characteristics and potential risks of various asteroids.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **API**: NASA’s Near Earth Object (NEO) API
- **Libraries**:
  - **VPython**: For 3D orbital visualization.
  - **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
  - **Requests**: For handling API calls to NASA’s NEO API.
- **Database** (optional): MySQL for saving user preferences or search history.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- VPython library
- Tkinter library
- Requests library

### **Step-by-Step Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asteroid-visualization-tool.git
    cd asteroid-visualization-tool
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install vpython tkinter requests
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

---

## **Usage**

1. **Open the Application**: Launch the program by running the `main.py` file.
2. **Select Date Range**: Use the GUI to input a specific date range for fetching NEO data.
3. **Filter Asteroids**: Filter the data by asteroid size, distance from Earth, or other characteristics.
4. **View in 3D**: Visualize the orbits of selected asteroids in a 3D environment.
5. **Educational Insights**: Explore additional information on each asteroid, including potential risks and their significance.
